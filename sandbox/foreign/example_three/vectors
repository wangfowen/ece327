# test vectors for testing a bidirectional transceiver.
#
# format:
#  each line must be of the form:
#         [type]  [time]  [[name=value] ...]
#
#   where type is either "test" or "drive"
#         time is the absolute time to drive the signal or test its value
#         name is the port name to test or drive
#         value is the std_logic or std_logic_vector to test for or drive to
#
# note: signal names must match port names in the entity declaration
#
# TEST 1: test A => B
#

# TEST 2: test tri-state disable
#
drive  100 portoe=1           porta=ZZZZZZZZ
